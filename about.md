### Background
My name is Kristina, I currently work in IT security as a junior analyst. Since I am still in the beginning stages of my career I am still 
trying to find my niche within the security community. My interests include pentesting (of course), DFIR, network security, pretty much anything else you can think of that is related to security, I'm not picky. My goal with this page is to document my journey as I progress through my career with the hopes of helping out other junior analysts or those looking to enter the security field. Hopefully as time passes I can bring something new and interesting to the community.
### Hobbies
Right now I am in the stage of trying multiple different things to see what sticks. I have a growing interest in reverse engineering, malware analysis, scripting, linux, and hardware hacking (arduino, etc) and mobile appsec. Pretty much anything related to computers. If i ever complete any interesting projects I will defintely be posting them here.
