title: eLearnsecurity eJPT course

Finally sitting down and going through the course content for eJPT, for those who arent familiar with it is a junior level 
penetration testing course from eLearnSecurity. I signed up last year but pretty much just slight browsed through the content
with no end date in mind since at the time I was also studying for the CISSP. Decided to take the time now with more downtime at home
to go ahead and get this out of the way. My hope is that the knowledge obtained in this course and through htb, tryhackme and vulnhub
to go for the OSCP cert within the end of the year.
###Course Layout
The course is broken down into 3 sections, Preliminary Skills - Prerequisites, Prelimary Skills - Programming and Penetration testing. I had poreviosuly completed the preliminary pre req section a few months ago and briefly looked through the programming section, I was going to skip the programming section since it is not on the exam but I have been putting off learning how to script for years now so its time to finally get the practice.
